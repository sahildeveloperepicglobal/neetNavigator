          For Diksha Midha, a student with a dream of becoming a doctor, the
          road to success was full of challenges. Despite her best efforts, she
          could only score 165 marks in NEET 2022. Her parents could afford to
          pay for her MBBS education in a private medical college, but they were
          not sure how to get her admission in a good medical college.

          Thats when they turned to NEET Navigator, India’s first advanced data
          analytics based medical admission counselling service. With their
          help, Diksha was able to navigate the complex process of MBBS
          admission and secure a seat in DY Patil Medical College in Pune on an
          NRI seat.

          right college for her studies.
